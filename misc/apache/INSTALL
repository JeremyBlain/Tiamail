Debian:

apt-get install apache2
a2enmod rewrite

Add the contents of the rewrite document into the configuration section for <Directory /var/www>

Copy x.gif into /var/www

If you use different paths or a different webserver, Tiamail by default expects the following:

/r/* is handled by the rewrite rule so that we get an access log entry like:

GET /r/10/20/http://www.google.ca/

This should then forward the user onto http://www.google.ca/

The parser reads looking for /r/10/20 for it's reporting.


The second url the templates include in the mail looks like:

/x.gif/10/20

This should serve an invisible gif.  The important part is the log entry for the parser to look for.
