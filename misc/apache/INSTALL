Debian:

apt-get install apache2
a2enmod rewrite

Add the contents of the rewrite document into the configuration section for <Directory /var/www>

Copy x.gif into /var/www

If you use different paths or a different webserver, Tiamail by default expects the following:

/r/* is handled by the rewrite rule so that we get an access log entry like:

GET /r/10/20/http://www.google.ca/

This should then forward the user onto http://www.google.ca/

The parser reads looking for /r/10/20 for it's reporting.


The second url the templates include in the mail looks like:

/x.gif/10/20

This should serve an invisible gif.  The important part is the log entry for the parser to look for.

Either of the logging formats below will work depending on if you are behind a proxy which sets x-forwarded-for or not.
Data recorders are left to their own devices parsing the x-forwarded-for header. 

# logging format when behind a proxy.
# this replaces the host with the xfowardedfor header.
LogFormat "\"%{X-Forwarded-For}i\" %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" tiaproxy
CustomLog "logs/access_log" tiaproxy

# combined log format with the host wrapped in ""'s to make sharing a parser with the format above easier.
LogFormat "\"%h\" %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" tiacombined
CustomLog "logs/access_log" tiacombined
